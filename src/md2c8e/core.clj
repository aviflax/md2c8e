  that specified by `threads`). This works well for trees that are wide but shallow. This may be
  sub-optimal for users whose document trees are deep, but this does work for my team for right now
  and thatâ€™s all I can do right now.
  
  The root page really should have children, because otherwise whatâ€™s the point? Those children
  might in turn have their own children, which might have children, etc; in other words; it might be
  a tree. All pages in the tree, except for the root, will be upserted.
  
  The root page must have an value for ::c8e/page-id.
  
  Returns a (flat) sequence of results. Each result will be either a representation of the remote
  page or an ::anom/anomaly."
